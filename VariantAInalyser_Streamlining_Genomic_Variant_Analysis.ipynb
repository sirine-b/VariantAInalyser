        "## 🧬 **Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to VariantAInalyser !\n",
        "\n",
        "VariantAInalyser is a comprehensive all-in-one platform that combines traditional bioinformatics with generative AI to streamline genomic variant analysis from VCF files, eliminating the need to juggle multiple specialised tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 👩🏻‍🔬 **The Challenge**\n",
        "\n",
        "Genomic variants are essential biomarkers for understanding diseases, drug responses, and creating personalised treatment plans. However, traditional analysis workflows force researchers to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Switch between multiple disconnected tools (VCF parsers, annotation software, database interfaces)\n",
        "- Master different user interfaces and data formats\n",
        "- Manually integrate results across platforms\n",
        "- Spend valuable time on technical tasks rather than interpretation\n",
        "\n",
        "This fragmented approach creates inefficiencies, increases the potential for errors, and significantly extends analysis time.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 💡 **The Solution: VariantAInalyser!**\n",
        "\n",
        "VariantAInalyser revolutionises genomic analysis by unifying the entire workflow in a single, intuitive interface. This integrated pipeline:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Consolidates multiple tools into one platform**, eliminating the need to switch between systems\n",
        "- **Automates the complete workflow** from raw VCF data to clinical interpretation\n",
        "- **Requires minimal technical expertise** to operate effectively\n",
        "\n",
        "Researchers and clinicians can now:\n",
        "- Process VCF files to extract critical variant data\n",
        "- Run SegmentNT analysis to identify genomic regions\n",
        "- Query ClinVar for clinical significance\n",
        "- Generate comprehensive reports\n",
        "- Ask questions in natural language\n",
        "\n",
        "All without ever leaving the interface or needing to reformat data between tools!\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🤖 **Generative AI Capabilities**\n",
        "\n",
        "VariantAInalyser's unified approach leverages cutting-edge AI to replace what traditionally required multiple specialised tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Retrieval Augmented Generation**: VariantAInalyser combines the power of Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model with contextual retrieval from genomic data. As shown in the methods defined within the ScientificTextGenerator class (i.e. generate_report(), ask_agent(), and generate_comparision()), the system dynamically retrieves relevant genomic information from the analysis pipeline and integrates it into the prompt, enabling Gemini to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses based on the specific variants being analysed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Grounding**: Ensures that Gemini's responses are firmly anchored in the actual genomic data processed by the system rather than generic information. The implementation binds the AI to concrete facts from VCF files, ClinVar database results, and SegmentNT predictions, preventing hallucinations and ensuring scientific accuracy in the generated reports. This grounding mechanism creates a direct link between specific variant characteristics and the AI's interpretations of their clinical significance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Document Understanding**: VariantAInalyser demonstrates strong document understanding by parsing and extracting key information from complex genomic data files (like VCFs). It leverages bioinformatics libraries (pysam and BioPython) to preprocess and structure the data, enabling the LLM to reason about the variants and their significance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Structured Output Generation**: The pipeline automatically produces organised and clinically relevant reports from raw VCF input, SegmentNT outputs and queried ClinVar data  in a way that's ready for clinical review. The LLM is prompted to generate responses in a controlled, consistent format, making the results easy to interpret and use.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🏁 **Getting Started**\n",
        "\n",
        "Before using VariantAInalyser, you'll need:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Google API key**\n",
        "   - Generate it from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)\n",
        "   - Add to the designated field in the interface\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **ClinVar API key** (optional)\n",
        "   - Create a free [NCBI account](https://account.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/signup/?back_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F)\n",
        "   - Navigate to \"Account Settings\"\n",
        "   - Generate an API key in the \"API Key Management\" section\n",
        "   - Add to the corresponding field in the interface\n",
        "\n",
        "🗒️ **Note**: No worries if you don't have a ClinVar API key, you will still be able to use the VariantAInalyser interface. The ClinVar API key helps avoid rate limiting for multiple queries, but for typical use cases, the system should work fine without it :)\n"

        "1. **Setup**: Enter your Google API key and Clinvar API key (this one is optional) into their corresponding boxes and click \"Apply API Key/s\"\n",
        "2. **Upload Data**: Upload a VCF file containing genetic variants by clicking on the \"Upload VCF file\" button. You can download an example gzipped VCF folder containing multiple variants' VCF files from the official NCBI ClinVar webpage by clicking on this link: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/vcf_GRCh38/clinvar_papu.vcf.gz.    \n",
        "**NOTE**: To create the altered genome, a reference genome (i.e. with no variant) is needed. The majority of the variants present in the previously linked VCF folder are present in the Y chromosome. As such, I have uploaded the reference genome of chromosome Y as a FASTA file in the Input directory under the \"/kaggle/input/example-chromosome-genome-fasta-file\" folder. The notebook directly links to this file whenever it needs the reference genome so there is no need to make any changes in the code. However, if you would like to test out a different VCF file with variants on other chromosomes, make sure to upload the genome of those chromosomes and change the path to the relevant one in the prepare_altered_genome() method.\n",
        "3. **Explore Variants**: View extracted variant information displayed on the interface\n",
        "4. **Ask Questions**: Use the chat to ask questions about your variants\n",
        "    Examples of questions to ask include (you can ask all of them and in this order if you would like to experience all the features offered by the interface):\n",
        "   - Please analyse in detail variant 1.\n",
        "   - Analyze (different spelling on purpose to check the how spelling-proof the intent function is) variant 7.\n",
        "   - Please plot the SegmentNT results.\n",
        "   - Can you explain the results generated in a simple and concise manner?\n",
        "   - You mentionned that the variant was located in the 5'UTR, what is that?\n",
        "   - Please compare variants 1 and 7. Is one more likely to be pathogenic than the other?\n",
        "6. **Download Results**: The generated analysis reports and plots are automatically saved into the output directory. You also have the possibility to download the chat history for future reference!"
